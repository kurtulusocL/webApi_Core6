# webApi_Core6
--------------
I did not create to this project layer by layer. Because it was a sample for relationship database by Asp.Net Api Core 6. If you want to create this project with layer, 
onion architecture, after create to layers, create one generic repository instead of interfaces and repositories folder in core layer. Then inteherit to your interface.
Use business layer and call from ApiLayer to business layer.
